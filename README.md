**Author**: Bruno Oliveira ([@nicoddemus](https://github.com/nicoddemus))

**Write better Python code with simple and maintainable tests**

## What is this book about?

Python's standard unittest module is based on the xUnit family of frameworks, which has its origins in Smalltalk and Java, and tends to be verbose to use and not easily extensible.The pytest framework on the other hand is very simple to get started, but powerful enough to cover complex testing integration scenarios, being considered by many the true Pythonic approach to testing in Python.
  
This book covers the following exciting features:
* Write and run simple and complex tests
* Organize tests in fles and directories
* Find out how to be more productive on the command line
* Markers and how to skip, xfail and parametrize tests
* Explore fxtures and techniques to use them effectively, such as tmpdir, pytestconfg, and monkeypatch

## Instructions and Navigation

All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code looks like the following:

```python
    # contents of test_player_mechanics.py
    def test_player_hit():
        player = create_player()
        assert player.health == 100
        undead = create_undead()
        undead.hit(player)
        assert player.health == 80
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for Python programmers that want to learn more about testing. This book is also for QA testers, and those who already benefit from programming with tests daily but want to improve their existing testing tools.	

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-7).
